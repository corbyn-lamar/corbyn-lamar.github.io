        <span id="spanStuff">Problem: My college essay was similar to other people’s college essays who had a passion/interest.</span>
        <span id="spanStuff">Solution: I started brainstorming on reasons why I liked game design and computer science. I wrote down many different scenarios when I remembered “this is what I want to do when I grow up” and included them in my essay.</span>
        <span id="spanStuff">Reasoning: Having different personal experiences in an essay allows it to be personalized and become better overall. Brainstorming and writing things down allowed me to express the root of my passion. I expressed what about the topic excited me. It wasn’t just about making games, it was about the experience of the game itself and how that translates into future technologies. If I could make a game, what was stopping me from taking that a step further with virtual simulations and physical adaptations. People having passion about something is what drives innovation for new technologies to develop through hard work and determination. My excitement for which career I would want to go into translates into the college’s plans with me.</span>
